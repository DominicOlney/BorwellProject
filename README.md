# Borwell_Project
Code for the software challenge

To run my project, click the clone code button and select “Open with Visual Studio”. Once my program has been cloned press F5 and the program will execute.

Assumptions made by my project:
The room is assumed to be a cuboid shape. Volume is calculated by multiplying length, width and height and area of floor is calculated by multiplying length and width.
The room is assumed to have no windows or doors. The paint requirement figure calculated consists of the total area of all four walls.

If I had more time, I would refine my project to have more validation. Current validation only prevents the user from inputting anything other than float values into the 
textboxes which allows the calculations to run with no errors but the user can still enter 0 which creates a logic error rather than a syntax error with the code. 
Furthermore, with additional development I would add a feature where the user can input door or window dimensions to exclude these areas from the paint required calculation. 
Finally, I would add conversion for the paint required so the figure is in a more convenient measurement such as litres rather than square meters.
